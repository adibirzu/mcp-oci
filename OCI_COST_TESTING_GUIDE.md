Success Criteria: Multiple services listed with costs > 0
```

#### Test 3: Anomaly Detection
```

```

### Phase 2: Enhanced FinOpsAI Tools Testing

#### Test 4: Monthly Trend Forecasting
```
Tool: monthly_trend_forecast
Purpose: Test advanced trend analysis and forecasting
Parameters: tenancy_ocid, months_back=6
Expected: Monthly cost series with trend direction and forecast
Success Criteria: No serialization errors, meaningful trend data
```

#### Test 5: Service Cost Drilldown
```
Tool: service_cost_drilldown
Purpose: Test hierarchical cost analysis
Parameters: tenancy_ocid, time_start, time_end, top_n=10
Expected: Top services with compartment breakdowns
Success Criteria: Services ranked by cost with compartment details
```

#### Test 6: FOCUS ETL Health Check
```
Tool: focus_etl_healthcheck
Purpose: Verify FOCUS compliance reporting
Parameters: tenancy_ocid, days_back=14
Expected: Daily FOCUS file presence status
Success Criteria: List of dates with present/absent status
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics Testing

#### Test 7: Cost Spike Detection
```
Tool: top_cost_spikes_explain
Purpose: Identify and explain cost anomalies
Parameters: tenancy_ocid, time_start, time_end, top_n=5
Expected: Day-over-day cost spikes with explanations
Success Criteria: Spike events with service/compartment attribution
```

#### Test 8: Unit Economics Analysis
```
Tool: per_compartment_unit_cost
Purpose: Calculate unit costs by compartment
Parameters: tenancy_ocid, time_start, time_end, unit="OCPU_HOUR"
Expected: Unit cost calculations per compartment
Success Criteria: Cost per unit metrics for compute resources
```

#### Test 9: Budget vs Forecast Analysis
```
Tool: forecast_vs_universal_credits
Purpose: Compare forecasted spend against credits
Parameters: tenancy_ocid, months_ahead=1, credits_committed=50000
Expected: Forecast vs credits comparison with risk assessment
Success Criteria: Risk categorization (NEUTRAL/OVER/UNDER) with analysis
```

## 📊 FinOps Practitioner Usage Patterns

### Daily Operations Workflow

#### Morning Cost Review (5 minutes)
1. **Get cost summary** - Last 7 days overview
2. **Get usage breakdown** - Identify top spending services
3. **Detect cost anomaly** - Check for unusual spending patterns

#### Weekly Analysis (15 minutes)
1. **monthly_trend_forecast** - Understand spending trends
2. **service_cost_drilldown** - Deep dive into top services
3. **top_cost_spikes_explain** - Investigate any cost spikes

#### Monthly Strategic Review (30 minutes)
1. **forecast_vs_universal_credits** - Credit utilization planning
2. **per_compartment_unit_cost** - Unit economics optimization
3. **focus_etl_healthcheck** - Compliance and reporting verification

### Cost Optimization Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Budget Overrun Investigation
```
1. Get cost summary (current period vs budget)
2. Service cost drilldown (identify major contributors)
3. Top cost spikes explain (find unusual spending)
4. Per compartment unit cost (optimize resource allocation)
```

#### Scenario 2: Forecasting and Planning
```
1. Monthly trend forecast (understand patterns)
2. Forecast vs universal credits (plan credit usage)
3. Service cost drilldown (plan service allocation)
4. FOCUS ETL healthcheck (ensure data quality)
```

#### Scenario 3: Cost Anomaly Response
```
1. Detect cost anomaly (confirm unusual activity)
2. Top cost spikes explain (understand root causes)
3. Service cost drilldown (compartment-level analysis)
4. Get usage breakdown (service-level details)
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "No result received from client-side tool execution"
**Cause**: Tool timeout or parameter validation error
**Solution**:
- Verify OCI credentials are properly configured
- Check tenancy_ocid parameter format
- Reduce date range for large data queries

#### Issue: FinOpsAI tools returning serialization errors
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Updated to use safe serialization
**Solution**: Enhanced server now includes robust error handling

#### Issue: Empty or zero cost data
**Cause**: Wrong compartment scope or time period
**Solution**:
- Verify tenancy_ocid is correct
- Use broader date ranges (last 30 days)
- Check if Usage API is enabled in OCI

#### Issue: Budget analysis tools failing
**Cause**: Missing budget configuration or permissions
**Solution**:
- Create budgets in OCI console first
- Ensure proper IAM policies for Budget API access
- Use get_cost_summary as fallback
